# Project for the Polimi course "Reti Logiche"

Developed together with [Ivan Motasov](https://github.com/motish97).

This project is the implementation of the working-zone encoding as described by E. Musoll, T. Lang and J. Cortadella in 
[“Working-zone encoding for reducing the energy in microprocessor address buses”](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/736129?arnumber=736129), 
in IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems, vol. 6, no. 4, pp. 568-572, Dec. 1998.


Some of the tests come from other colleagues.
